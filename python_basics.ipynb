        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "   - Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability, simplicity, and versatility. It supports multiple programming paradigms such as procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "   - An interpreter is a program that reads and executes code directly, line by line, rather than compiling it into machine code beforehand.\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "   - if, else, while, for, try, import, return.\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "  - No, keywords cannot be used as variable names in Python.\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "   - Mutability refers to whether an object's state can be modified after it is created.\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "   - Lists are mutable, meaning their elements can be changed, added, or removed.\n",
        "   - Tuples are immutable because they are designed to provide a stable and unchangeable sequence of elements.\n",
        "7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        "   - == checks if the values of two objects are equal.\n",
        "   - is checks if two objects refer to the same memory location.\n",
        "8. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "   - Logical operators in Python are used to combine conditional statements\n",
        "      - and: Returns True if both conditions are true.\n",
        "      - or: Returns True if at least one condition is true.\n",
        "      - not: Reverses the logical state.\n",
        "9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "   - Type casting is the process of converting one data type to another.\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "    - Implicit type casting occurs automatically by Python when it converts a smaller data type to a larger data type.\n",
        "    - Explicit type casting is done by the programmer using functions like int(), float(), etc.\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "    - Conditional statements in Python, such as if, elif, and else, allow the program to make decisions based on certain conditions. They control the flow of execution by evaluating conditions and executing different blocks of code accordingly.\n",
        "12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "    - The elif statement is used when there are multiple conditions to check. If the condition in if is not true, Python will check the condition in the elif block. If true, it will execute that block and skip the rest. If no elif conditions are true, the else block will be executed.\n",
        "13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "    - A for loop is used when you know the number of iterations or are iterating over a sequence.\n",
        "    - A while loop is used when you want to continue looping until a condition is no longer true, but you don’t necessarily know how many iterations will occur in advance.\n",
        "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop?\n",
        "    - A while loop is more suitable when the number of iterations is not known ahead of time and depends on a condition that may change during the execution.\n",
